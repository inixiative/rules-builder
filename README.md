# @inixiative/rules-builder

Headless visual rule builder for [@inixiative/json-rules](https://github.com/inixiative/json-rules).

Compose a json-rules `Condition` against a **lens** — driven by the lens's
exposed surface and the json-rules operator catalog, so the builder always offers
exactly what the engine can run. The hook renders nothing: you bring your own
components (or copy the reference renderers).

**Live demo:** [www.inixiative.com/rules-builder](https://www.inixiative.com/rules-builder/) — the lifecycle playground (fieldMaps → bridges → lenses → narrowings → sources → builder → value picker).

## Install

```bash
bun add @inixiative/rules-builder @inixiative/json-rules
```

`react` and `@inixiative/json-rules` are peer dependencies.

## Quick start

`useRuleBuilder` owns the `Condition` JSON and returns a **descriptor tree** — a
`root` group whose nodes carry the controls (field / operator / value), their
options, and bound actions. You walk the tree and render it however you like.

```tsx
import { useRuleBuilder, type BuilderNode, type GroupNode, type LeafNode } from '@inixiative/rules-builder';

const source = {
  maps: {
    app: {
      models: {
        User: {
          fields: {
            role: { kind: 'enum', type: 'UserRole' },
            age: { kind: 'scalar', type: 'Int' },
          },
        },
      },
      enums: { UserRole: ['admin', 'member', 'guest'] },
    },
  },
  mapName: 'app',
  model: 'User',
};

function RuleEditor() {
  const { root, value } = useRuleBuilder({ source, defaultValue: { all: [] } });
  return <Node node={root} />; // `value` is the clean, serializable Condition
}

function Node({ node }: { node: BuilderNode }) {
  if (node.kind === 'group') return <Group node={node} />;
  if (node.kind === 'array') return <ArrayRule node={node} />;
  return <Leaf node={node as LeafNode} />;
}

function Leaf({ node }: { node: LeafNode }) {
  const { field, operator, value } = node;
  return (
    <div>
      <select value={field.value} onChange={(e) => field.set(e.target.value)}>
        {field.options.map((o) => <option key={o.value} value={o.value}>{o.label}</option>)}
      </select>
      <select value={operator.value} onChange={(e) => operator.set(e.target.value)}>
        {operator.options.map((o) => <option key={o.value} value={o.value}>{o.label}</option>)}
      </select>
      <ValueField control={value} />
      <button onClick={node.remove}>✕</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Rendering values

`useRuleBuilder` is headless — it does **not** render value inputs, because the
right input depends on the operator's `shape` and the field's `kind`. The
`ValueControl` gives you everything to switch on:

| Signal | Render |
| --- | --- |
| `control.options` present | a `<select>` / chips (enum or **sourced** field) |
| `control.shape === 'array'` | a multi-select (e.g. `in` / `notIn`) |
| `control.shape === 'range'` | two inputs (e.g. `between`) |
| `control.shape === 'none'` | no input (e.g. `isEmpty`) |
| `control.kind === 'Boolean'` | a true/false select — coerce to a real boolean |
| `control.kind === 'Int' \| 'Float'` | a number input — coerce with `Number()` |
| `control.kind === 'DateTime'` | a date input |

Coercion matters: store `true`, not `"true"`. The two reference renderers in the
demo — [`RuleTree.tsx`](./examples/RuleTree.tsx) (plain) and
[`RuleTreeShadcn.tsx`](./examples/RuleTreeShadcn.tsx) (shadcn/ui) — implement this
matrix in full. They're **copy-paste** (shadcn-style), not exported: drop one in
and adapt it.

### Per-control validity

Each `LeafNode` exposes `valid` (the whole row), and `field.valid` / `value.valid`
pinpoint which control is wrong (field doesn't resolve in the surface; value
falls outside an enum/sourced set) so you can mark the exact input.

## Sourced fields (data-backed options)

A narrowing can declare `sources` — a field whose option set is the DISTINCT
values of its own column (after an eligibility `where`). The engine compiles the
queries; your app runs them and hands the results back:

```ts
import { runSources, useRuleBuilder } from '@inixiative/rules-builder';

const sourceValues = runSources(narrowing, rows); // rows: { [model]: Record<string, unknown>[] }
useRuleBuilder({ source, sourceValues }); // sourced fields now render as selects
```

In production you run the compiled query (`toSql` / `toPrisma`) against your DB;
`runSources` is the same shape over in-memory rows.

## Filtering a collection in hand

For collections fetched whole — a calendar range, a Kanban board — where the
server owns scope and the narrowing is display-only, `useFilteredCollection`
composes the builder with the in-memory half of the rules duality. The builder
owns the one `Condition`; sourced fields' options materialize from the rows
themselves (a plain column becomes a pseudo-enum picker of the values that
actually occur); `data` is the rows passing the emitted rule via `check()`:

```ts
import { useFilteredCollection } from '@inixiative/rules-builder';

const { data, root, value, setCondition } = useFilteredCollection({
  source: { maps, mapName, model, narrowing: { root: { sources: { rewardType: true } } } },
  rows, // the fetched collection
});
```

Emitted rules are coercion-stamped from the lens, so widget-authored values
(date strings, stringified numbers) match wire-format rows. `source`, `rows`,
and `checkOptions` must be referentially stable — memoize them at the call site.

## Array (list/relation) rules

A list or relation field builds an `ArrayNode` — a predicate / count / presence
over its elements:

- **presence** — `empty` / `notEmpty`
- **count** — `atLeast` / `atMost` / `exactly` (+ a numeric `count`)
- **predicate** — `all` / `any` / `none` (+ a `condition` sub-builder)

`node.condition` and `node.filter` are nested `GroupNode`s scoped to the **related
model's** surface — author them exactly like the top-level tree.

## Decoration — hoisting, relabeling & aliasing

By default the root selector offers only the anchor model's own fields; to reach
anything else you traverse relations. A **`Decoration`** pre-traverses for you: it
moves chosen lens locations *up* to the root selector as named **facets** and
relabels them. It is purely presentational — the lens stays the source of truth,
and every facet emits its real dotted path (bridges included) as the rule's
`field`, so nothing the engine runs changes.

```ts
import { useRuleBuilder, type Decoration } from '@inixiative/rules-builder';

const decoration: Decoration = {
  // any path from the anchor, additive to the anchor's own fields.
  // crosses `map:Model` bridge segments — reach other sources at the root.
  facets: [
    { path: 'salesforce:Contact.arr', label: 'Annual Revenue', icon: '💰' },
    { path: 'account.industry', label: 'Industry' },
  ],
  // relabel keyed structurally (`Model.field`) or by path — path wins on conflict.
  labels: {
    fields: { 'account.industry': { label: 'Industry' } },
    values: { tier: { gold: { label: 'Gold tier' } } },
  },
};

useRuleBuilder({ source, decoration }); // facets now appear in the root selector
```

The facet kind is decided by the path's shape against the lens (a path may
traverse any number of to-one relations/bridges first — `account.contracts.amount`
is fine):

- **Leaf** (ends at a scalar/enum) → a directly rule-able field; emits `{ field: path }`.
- **Collection** (a list relation crossed) → a top-level **array node**. json-rules
  can't evaluate a scalar operator over a list path (it silently mis-matches), so a
  list-crossing facet *must* seed a node, not a flat field.
- **Branch** (ends at a to-one relation, e.g. `account`) → a top-level **scoped
  group**. Its field picker is scoped to the related model and emits `account.*`
  dotted paths; a saved `account.*` group rehydrates as the named branch. Its
  `hoist`/`lockedLeading` live on the `GroupNode`. The scoped picker reaches
  **nested** to-one fields (`account.owner.email`) and offers list relations
  (`account.contracts`) as nested array nodes.

A facet can instead be a **preset** — `condition` in place of `path`: a named alias
for a *complete* pre-authored `Condition` (`{ label: 'Mature', condition: {…} }`).
Selecting it drops the whole condition in as one **atomic** node (`GroupNode.atomic`
/ `LeafNode.atomic`) — no field/operator/value pickers, it just *is* a rule — and a
saved node equal to the condition collapses back to the name. `validateDecoration`
checks the preset is a valid rule against the lens.

### Two `where`s

A collection facet carries two things, kept distinct because only one is identity:

- **`where`** — **fixed, non-editable**: the facet's identity. It sits on the model
  its fields reference (the **destination** the path travels to) as the leading
  condition(s), and is the *only* thing rehydration matches on.
- **`defaultWhere`** — the **array-traversal layer**: one `ArrayOperator` per array
  boundary the path crosses to reach that model, each defaulting to `any` (the
  "contains" semantic). Its length must equal the path's array-traversal count —
  `validateDecoration` enforces it. Editable defaults, not identity, never matched.

```ts
const decoration: Decoration = {
  facets: [
    // "NPS" = customFields where key='nps', reasoning over `value` as a number.
    { path: 'customFields.value', label: 'NPS', kind: 'Int',
      where: { field: 'key', operator: 'equals', value: 'nps' } },
    // NPS across a user's orders — two boundaries (`orders`, `customFields`).
    { path: 'orders.customFields.value', label: 'NPS across orders', kind: 'Int',
      where: { field: 'key', operator: 'equals', value: 'nps' }, defaultWhere: ['any', 'any'] },
    { path: 'orders', label: 'Orders' }, // whole collection
  ],
};
```

Selecting "NPS" seeds `customFields any ( key='nps' AND value … )` — `any(key=nps AND value…)`
is exactly "the NPS element matches." The multi-boundary one seeds
`orders any ( customFields any ( key='nps' AND value … ) )` — both boundary operators
come from `defaultWhere`, and the `where` lands on `CustomField`, whose fields it
actually references. Every traversal operator is **editable but hidden**
(`arrayOperator.hidden` on each array node); `kind` retypes an untyped
EAV `value` column so its operators are right.

**Move, not copy.** A facet that consumes a top-level field *wholesale* (a bare
relation, no `where`, no deeper leaf) is removed from the root selector — a thing
lives in one place. `where`/deep facets leave their origin.

**Rehydration.** A saved rule is a raw path/array node with no trace of the alias.
The builder recognizes it via `matchFacet` — a leaf by `field`, a collection when
its **leading condition block equals the facet's fixed `where`** — and **collapses
it back** to the named entry: a leaf gets a `hoist` badge; a collection gets
`hoist` + `lockedLeading` (how many leading conditions to hide) + `arrayOperator.hidden`,
with the element surface retyped by `kind`. So a reopened "NPS" reads as "NPS."

**No collisions.** Because rehydration matches on the leading `where`, the facet set
must be collision-free. `validateDecoration(lens, decoration)` returns violations
(empty = valid): unresolvable paths, duplicate ids, and — the key guarantee — two
facets on the same target whose fixed `where`s aren't prefix-free (a rule under the
specific one would also match the general one). Validate at construction.

`describeFacets` is the pure function behind hoisting; `decorationSurfaceOptions`
folds labels into the plain surface; `consumedTopFields` is the move-not-copy set;
`matchFacet` / `facetElementLeaf` / `facetLockedLeading` drive rehydration. Absent
`decoration`, behavior is unchanged.

**Nesting.** Fully recursive. A collection path crossing several lists
(`orders.items.sku`) seeds **nested array nodes** (`orders any (items any (sku …))`)
— a flat two-list path would silently mis-evaluate. A branch's scoped picker
descends nested to-one relations (`account.owner.email`) and surfaces lists as
nested array nodes. The fixed `where` is presentation, not security — the lens
gate doesn't enforce it.

### Splitting one relation into tagged sources

A single physical relation often carries rows from several integrations — a shared
EAV/enrichment table (`customFields`, `enrichments`) discriminated by a `system` /
`source` slug: "here are Salesforce's custom fields, here are Gong's." Because a
facet is just a `where`-slice of a relation, this needs **no new primitive** — point
several facets at the *same* path, each leading its `where` with a different slug,
and give each its own tag (`label` + `icon`):

```ts
const source = (system: string, label: string, icon: string) => ({
  path: 'customFields.value', kind: 'Int', label, icon,
  where: { all: [
    { field: 'system', operator: 'equals', value: system },
    { field: 'key', operator: 'equals', value: 'nps' },
  ] },
});
const decoration: Decoration = {
  facets: [source('a', 'System A', '🔵'), source('b', 'System B', '🟢'), source('c', 'System C', '🟠')],
};
```

Each source seeds its slug as a leading, locked condition, so it evaluates only on
its own integration's rows and rehydrates back to its own name. And since each is a
slice of the *same* relation, **the relation can be adjoined N times in one rule** —
one slice per source, each traversed independently:

```
{ all: [
    customFields any (system='a' AND key='nps' AND value … ),   // System A
    customFields any (system='b' AND key='nps' AND value … ),   // System B
    customFields any (system='c' AND key='nps' AND value … ),   // System C
] }
```

The slices are collision-free (`validateDecoration` enforces prefix-free `where`s),
compose for free, and each stays independently tagged. See
[`test/multiSourceAdjoin.test.ts`](./test/multiSourceAdjoin.test.ts). What's *not*
provided yet is ergonomic sugar — declaring `system='a'` once as a named scope and
grouping the picker into "System A/B/C" sections; that deferred `scope` concept and
its limits (sources carry a `where` filter but no provenance, so auto-*discovery* of
the sources is a separate problem) are in [docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](./docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md).

## Serialization

A rule loses meaning without its binding. `SavedRule` packages the rule with a
`source` reference and the captured `sourceValues`:

```ts
import { parseSavedRule, stringifySavedRule, type SavedRule } from '@inixiative/rules-builder';

const json = stringifySavedRule({ source: ref, rule, sourceValues });
const back = parseSavedRule(json); // validated; throws on malformed input
```

`source` is generic — a self-contained app stores a `RuleBuilderSource`; an app
with a registry stores its own by-name reference.

## API

- `useRuleBuilder(opts)` → `{ value, root, lens, setCondition, validate, describe }`
- `useFilteredCollection({ ...opts, rows, checkOptions? })` → the same surface plus `data` (rows passing the current rule)
- `buildRoot(condition, lens, fields, maxDepth, commit)` — the pure tree builder behind the hook
- `resolve(source, { sourceValues })` — compose a `RuleBuilderSource` (+ fetched values) into the exposed surface
- `describeModelFields(lens, map, model, { labels, valueLabels, targets })` — the selectable fields + operator sets
- `runSources(lensOrNarrowing, rows)` — DISTINCT option sets for sourced fields
- `lensValuePicker` / `useLensValuePicker` — the field/path picker atom
- `parseSavedRule` / `stringifySavedRule` — validated rule serialization
